Title: Visiting Bristol
Date: 2015-05-05

This last weekend Magda and I went west to visit Bristol and it was seriously good. Good enough to convince ourselves Bristol could be a good place to live for the following years.

_Very cool suspension bridge_

We were lucky enough to go for the same weekend [Food Connections](http://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/) was taking place. Lots of stands serving delicious food and drinks. We even found a Spanish one, serving paella, tapas and sangría. Apart from that, many Bristol City FC supporters came out to receive the team, which has recently achieved... some achievements.

We stayed in a local hotel which couldn't remind me more of [Fawlty Towers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/fawltytowers/index.shtml). Lovely staff, but old old old everything else. Good price for value, though. It was in the south of Clifton, beautiful neighborhood. We found it a bit posh, something our Bristol friends confirmed afterwards.

Unfortunately, on our first day there we got the weirdest weather we could have got. One third drizzle, one third wind, one third sun and two fifths rain – it didn't make any sense.

_Yeah, they all live in tents over there._

We'll definitely come back at some point during or after Summer. We want to explore more.
