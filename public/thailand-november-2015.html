<p>Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).</p>
<p>This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing – just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Something you usually assume before going to a <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a> offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading – no disrespect, Reading.</p>
<p>It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!</p>
