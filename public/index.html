<div class="blog-post__content"><p>For the last few months I haven't been coding much in my spare time. Not necessarily a bad thing though, I've been enjoying other aspects of life (videogames, movies, etc.).</p>
<p>However, I felt it's been a long while since I wrote some Python for a personal project, so I've decided to write a simple static site generator in Python - yes, I know about Pelican, I've used it in the past.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>No particular reason, but if I had to come up with one, I'd say I want to work on a simple problem, such as generating an static html site, that will make me come up with a solution without checking how other static site generators work. Just for fun.</p>
<p>Also, I've been re-reading SMACSS recently and I wanted to apply some of the knowledge before I forget about it.</p>
<h2>Technology that will be used</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python 3</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>BeautifulSoup 4</li>
</ul></div>

<p>Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).</p>
<p>This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing - just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Something you usually assume before going to a <a href="https://p.ota.to/">Potato</a> offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading - no disrespect, Reading.</p>
<p>It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!</p></div>
