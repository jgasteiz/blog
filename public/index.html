 Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).
</p>
<p>
 This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing - just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.

 Something you usually assume before going to a

  Potato

 offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading - no disrespect, Reading.
</p>
<p>
 It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!
