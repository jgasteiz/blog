<div class="blog-post__content"><h2>The problem</h2>
<p>For years, I've been the kind of person who always used the same three or four passwords for every single online service I used to have. Every time one of these services <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">got hacked</a>, I was supposed to change the password I was using for that service and in every other place, I was using that same password. Obviously, I wasn't keeping track of that, so I used to miss many of them.</p>
<p>Then 2-factor auth came to be and I started activating it for every service I considered important: Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Github, Gitlab... That made me feel much safer. But it had a couple of inconveniences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not every service offers 2-factor authentication and not all of them would offer the SMS one – I know it's not the safest, but it's the one I chose.</li>
<li>I would need my phone with me at all time, with network signal and always with the the UK number – this is a problem four or five times per year when I go to Spain and Poland.</li>
</ol>
<p>To be fair, it felt safe enough and I've been living like this for the last three years or so.</p>
<p>Then a few days ago I got another email from Dropbox, saying I need to change my password (again) because millions of account credentials have been leaked (again). That got me a bit upset, so I finally got proactive about it and started looking for a solution to my problem - because the fact I'm not dealing with my security properly is my problem, not Dropbox.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>I got myself <a href="https://1password.com/security/">1Password</a>.</p>
<p>I've changed every password in every single online service I've used during this week and updated every single 2-factor auth code to use the 1Password app rather than my phone - equivalent of using Google Authenticator, for instance.</p>
<p><em>Most</em> of the pain and insecurity has disappeared. Now every password I'm using is different. They are long and combine letters, symbols and numbers. Just a couple of minor caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>I still need to remember one single, safe password. No problem with this, the passwords I was using in the past were (apparently) quite safe. I just had to come up with a new one and learned it.</li>
<li>It's still not the great experience using it on the phone. Not very comfortable having to introduce the master password in the phone every time I need to get another password or OTP code.</li>
<li>If you need to enter a specific password many times on a mobile device, you'll end up hating all this security.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Get a password manager or a service that will make you create secure passwords. Not necessarily 1Password – it's a paid service –, but something will be better than nothing.</p>

<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 09 July 2016</span>

<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Two weeks ago, actually. After almost three weeks in Poland, we're finally back home. I have to say I've missed it a bit. It's been great taking so many days off, being with friends and family and taking days off in general. But it's been hectic. We haven't really stopped doing things for a single day until now.</p>
<p>So, what's like being married? Not much has changed, really. Magda has now a new surname, but that's mostly it.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe how things used to be 30 years ago. My parents, for instance, weren't living together before getting married. Which means they didn't know how life together was going to be until after getting married, such a commitment! Our thing is easy, Magda and I have been living together for almost 3 years now, we (kind of) knew what we were doing.</p>
<p>We decided we wouldn't go on our honeymoon straight after the wedding, but a few months after, to Japan. I'm really looking forward to it. Now we <em>only</em> have to start organising the trip!</p>
<p>Anyway, I leave you a couple of pictures we took the week after the wedding. Thanks to Magda's cousin for taking them!</p>

<h1 class="blog-post__title"><a href="promotions.html">Promotions</a></h1>
<span class="blog-post__date">Saturday, 23 April 2016</span>
</div>
<div class="blog-post__content"><p>Last Wednesday I got good news at <a href="https://p.ota.to">Potato</a>: I've been promoted to senior developer :)</p>
<p>It's been roughly a year since I decided to ask for more responsibilities at work - tech leading small things at first, big ones until now - and it seems I've been doing things well (or so I've been told).</p>
<p>The reason I decided to ask for it was that I was going to get more variety of work than if I decided to stay the way I was. Which wasn't bad, but most of the times I felt like I wasn't being challenged and I really thought I could do more. Since then I've been lucky enough to work on Android and Arduino related stuff, tech lead a couple of short projects and more recently being the tech lead of a big team (oscillating between 6 and 8 people).</p>
<p>I think I could have got the promotion a bit earlier if I had pushed for it a bit more, but I really didn't want to rush it. Rushing it would have meant forcing myself to learn things faster and I think this is one of those things it's better learnt slowly.</p>
<p>The main difference I've noticed during the last year is that I now have to deal with people much more than I used to: people will ask you questions which answers you won't always know and figuring out how to solve these situations is, most of the times, a lot of fun.</p></div>
