Title: I've built a thing
Date: 2018-03-08

I like reading comics and for the last couple of years I've been reading and collecting a bunch of them – can't wait for the next time I change flats, yay. Because the idea of moving flats terrorises me, I've often thought about moving to digital and stop buying paper comics. But I can't, I really like to feel the physical books on my hands. I suspect that in a few years, when big sized tablets such as the iPad Pro 12" become affordable, I might make a full move to digital. But until then, it's all about paper.

Something I've realised though is that once I own the physical comic book and I've read it, I don't really mind too much re-reading or looking at it digitally. So a few months ago I came with the idea of digitalising my entire comic library. I'm doing this for the following reasons:

- I want to be able to access all my comics in any way I like, at the best possible quality (I'm looking at you, Comixology), from any device I like. Because they are mine!
- I want to _unrust_ my Android and iOS skills.
- I want to give some use to my Raspberry PI 3.
- I'm curious about the technical challenge all of this represents.

## Stage 1 - Collect all the comics

The first thing I need in order to create a digital comic library is the content: digital copies of my comic books. Finding most of them online isn't hard, but some of them represent a challenge: I have some Spanish comic books that have never been digitalized, so I've had to find their English versions instead.

Apart from my physical library, I also have a big number of comics on Comixology: mainly the ones that I don't really mind not having on paper because I only want to read them and I don't want them to take space on my shelve or perhaps because Comixology had an amazing sale, which unfortunately for my wallet, happens often.

It has taken me weeks to get to a point where I have the same content in both bookshelves, digital and physical, but I get finally get there – almost actually, still missing a few.

## Stage 2 - Put it on the local network

For that, I've got a NAS that I've connected to the internet router. A 2TB WD My Cloud does the job. After putting all the digital comics on the network hard drive, a quick test to make sure this will be accessible on my local network, it works!

## Stage 3 - Raspberry PI 3

Not complicating myself with this one. I've installed [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) which does the local server job perfectly fine. Also installed [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) as a web server.

## Stage 4 - The apps

This is by far what has taken longer of them all. I've had to build 3 different apps to get this stuff working.

1. A Django app which works as a server for delivering the directories with comics and the individual pages of each comic when reading them. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home). For reading the comics, I've used React because I wanted a quick way of giving the API a test before writing the native apps.
2. An Android app which works as a client and connects to the Django API and lets me read my digital comics. I've recently added "offline" reading, so I can download my comics when I'm at home and read them anywhere I like. It works fairly decently, but I want to improve the downloading bit - currently blocking the main UI thread a bit when showing the "download progress". The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-android).
3. An iOS app I started building and it's almost there! I can already browse the folders and read a comic, but I need to work more on the page zooming and navigation. I also need to add the offline mode to this one. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-ios).

**Now, some screenshots of how the apps look like**

## Final thoughts and moral concerns

Unfortunately, in order to get digital copies of some of my comic books I've had to *obtain them* from dark places on the internet – I'm sorry, but after spending £30 on a heavy and nice hardcover comic book, I'm not going to spend £20 on its digital version. Some others, especially a lot of the Image ones, I've been able to get through amazing sales on [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) (in this case I've actually bought some comics twice) and I've been able to get some others from the Comixology "backup" option they offer on some comics - not on many though.

Marvel and DC have been doing something pretty cool during the last year or so: when you buy a paper issue, some of them will come with a "code" that will unlock that same comic book on the digital comics platform Comixology. That's great and I hope others like Image, Dark Horse, Dynamite, etc. will start doing the same at some point. I really prefer reading them on paper, but I also enjoy re-reading some of them digitally because the colours look so great on a screen.

All that said, my conscience is clean because I know I've spent honest money on supporting the artists, editors, distributors and librarians by buying **a lot** of paper comics from many, many comic shops.

Finally, I didn't want to finish this blog post without actually showing how my physical bookshelves look like:

PS: Buy comics. Support the artists, editors, distributors, librarians and everyone who takes part in the process of bringing this great art to you.
