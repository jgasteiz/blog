Title: I've built a thing
Date: 2018-03-08

I like reading comics and for the last couple of years I've been reading and collecting a bunch of them – can't wait for the next time I change flats, yay. Because the idea of moving flats terrorises me, I've often thought about moving to digital and stop buying paper comics. But I can't, I really like to feel the physical books on my hands. I suspect that in a few years, when big sized tablets such as the iPad Pro 12" become affordable, I might make a full move to digital. But until then, it's all about paper.

Something I've realised though is that once I own the physical comic book and I've read it, I don't really mind too much re-reading or looking at it digitally. So a few months ago I came with the idea of digitalising my entire comic book collection. I'm doing this for the following reasons:

- I want to be able to access all my comics in any way I like, at the best possible quality (I'm looking at you, Comixology), from any device I like. Because they are mine!
- I want to _unrust_ my Android and iOS skills.
- I want to give some use to my Raspberry Pi 3.
- I'm curious about the technical challenge all of this represents.

## Stage 1 - Collect all the comics

The first thing I need in order to create a digital comic book library is its content: digital copies of my comic books. Finding most of them online isn't hard, but getting some of them is plainly impossible: I have some Spanish comic books that have never been digitalized, so I've had to find their English versions instead. And no, I won't scan them myself.

Apart from my physical library, I also have a big number of comics on Comixology: mainly the ones that I don't really mind not having on paper because I don't care too much about them or perhaps because Comixology has had an amazing sale, which unfortunately for my wallet, happens often.

It has taken me weeks to get to a point where I have almost the same content in both bookshelves, digital and physical.

## Stage 2 - Put it on the local network

For that, I've acquired a NAS that I've connected to my local network. A 2TB WD My Cloud does the job.

After putting all the digital comics on the network hard drive, a quick test to make sure this will be accessible on my local network, it works!

## Stage 3 - The apps

This has taken longer than the other "stages". I've built 3 different apps to get everything working the way I like:

1. A Django app which works as a server for delivering the directories with comics and the individual pages of each comic when reading them. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home). I've built the actual "comic reading app" using React, because I wanted a quick way of giving the API a test before writing the native apps and it has turned out to be a very simple solution to the problem of having to write a web comic reader. I'm also using Django Rest Framework for putting together a very simple API to serve individual comic pages.
2. An Android app which works as a client and connects to the Django API and lets me read my digital comics. I've recently added "offline" reading, so I can download my comics when I'm at home and read them anywhere I like. It works fairly well, but I want to improve the "downloading" feature - I'm updating the UI too much showing the download progress on the main thread, looking into writing a service for dealing with that. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-android).
3. I've also started writing an iOS app, which is almost done now! I can already browse the folders and read a comic, but the reader definitely needs more love. Zooming and page browsing is not there yet. I also need to add the offline mode to this one. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home-ios).

## Stage 4 - Setting up the Raspberry Pi 3

Simple, cheap and way more powerful than the Raspberry Pi 2 (which I also have lying around).

A few details on what I'm running here:

- [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).
- [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/).
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
- [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/).
- [The django app mentioned in Stage 3](https://github.com/jgasteiz/comic-reader-home).

The only thing I need to do for this to work is mount the network drive on a local directory and point the `comic-reader-home` app to that location.

## Final thoughts and moral concerns

Unfortunately, in order to get digital copies of some of my comic books I've had to *obtain them* from dark places on the internet – I'm sorry, but after spending £30 on a heavy and nice hardcover comic book, I'm not going to spend £20 on its digital version. Some others, especially a lot of the Image ones, I've been able to get through amazing sales on [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/) (in this case I've actually bought some comics twice) and I've been able to get some others from the Comixology "backup" option they offer on some comics - not on many though.

Marvel and DC have been doing something pretty cool during the last year or so: when you buy a paper issue, some of them will come with a "code" that will unlock that same comic book on the digital comics platform Comixology. That's great and I hope others like Image, Dark Horse, Dynamite, etc. will start doing the same at some point. I really prefer reading them on paper, but I also enjoy re-reading some of them digitally because the colours look so great on a screen.

All that said, my conscience is clean because I know I've spent honest money on supporting the artists, editors, distributors and librarians by buying **a lot** of paper comics from many, many comic shops.

Finally, I didn't want to finish this blog post without actually showing how my actual collection look like:

(Yes, I know it's all a bit chaotic)

PS: Buy comics. Support the artists, editors, distributors, librarians and everyone who takes part in the process of bringing this great art to you.
