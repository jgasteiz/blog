Title: Mountain View & San Francisco 2015
Date: 2015-07-18

Exactly today it's been two months since I went to the USA (Mountain View and San Francisco) for a couple of weeks to work on a project. And I realised, just now, I didn't leave anywhere any record of it. Unfortunately, I can't tell what I was working on, but I can assure it was some good software and hardware fun.

One good thing I got from this trip is some reassurance of how much I like the UK. Despite of how lovely everyone I met there was, I just can't live with the fact that everything is so damn far. It doesn't matter where you want to go, it'll be far and you'll need a car to get there.

Some pictures from Mountain View:

_We saw a few of them, several times_

In our day off, we visited the Computer History Museum. Very interesting stuff.

And not much more to show from there, we were quite busy. We spent around ten days in Mountain View, then we moved to San Francisco.

Now some pictures from San Francisco.

I'd add some Google IO pictures, but I can't really find any interesting ones! On the other hand, here's a video of the first day post Google IO party. Very cool.

Ah right, I forgot about this one!

_I played for a while, it turned out quite fun!_

And that was pretty much it, I came back home truly exhausted. Great experience overall with its ups and downs (mostly ups, to be fair). Hopefully I'll have the chance to get into another project overseas again.
