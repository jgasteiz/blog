For the last few months I haven't been coding much in my spare time. Not necessarily a bad thing though, I've been enjoying other aspects of life (videogames, movies, etc.).

However, I felt it's been a long while since I wrote some Python for a personal project, so I've decided to write a simple static site generator in Python - yes, I know about Pelican, I've used it in the past.

### Why?

No particular reason, but if I had to come up with one, I'd say I want to work on a simple problem, such as generating an static html site, that will make me come up with a solution without checking how other static site generators work. Just for fun.

Also, I've been re-reading SMACSS recently and I wanted to apply some of the knowledge before I forget about it.

### Technology that will be used

- Python 3
- Markdown
- BeautifulSoup 4
