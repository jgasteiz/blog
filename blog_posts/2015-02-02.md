Title: What I've been up to
Date: 2015-02-02

Yes, I also thought this blog was dead. It's not like I didn't have anything to write about, I've actually done a lot of things during these last five months. I don't really have an excuse for not writing.

Remembering all the stuff will be easier with the help of some pictures, so here it goes.

### September

The first half of September was so quiet, the second half was a complete madness to compensate. During exactly 2 weeks, I spent the first five days in Poland – my first Polish wedding – and the last ten in the USA, with Potato.

_Dancing and sweating is as important as drinking during a Polish wedding, if not more._

_And because vodka was really good quality, this wasn't really necessary._

The Potato offsite went over all expectations. This year there was not only one destination, but three: Santa Monica, Las Vegas and Palm Springs, in that order. The first stop offered a good balance of party possibilities, beach and relax. Vegas was a big rollercoaster to our bodies and brains. And Palm Springs was probably the only possible way we had to calm ourselves down before coming back.

Pics!

_Party Bus - getting on any bus hasn't been the same since then._

_Yes._

_Palm Springs, such a nice desertic views._

With a few extra pounds in our bellies and a _never-seen-before_ jet lag, I somehow manage to start working on my second day back in London.

### October

Pretty much nothing here. The offsite left my brain half dead for 80% of the month and the only thing I remember from this month is the Halloween pumpkins we carved.

### November

This is when I start feeling interested in unconventional literature.

_Back cover of Randall Munroe's ["what if?"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-If-Scientific-Hypothetical-Questions/dp/1848549571/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422988960&sr=1-1&keywords=what+if%3F)._

I also added other titles to my library such as ["Diary of Edward the hamster"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Diary-Edward-Hamster-1990/dp/075222803X), ["Terrible estate agent photos"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Terrible-Estate-Agent-Photos-Donaldson/dp/0224100912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422988914&sr=1-1&keywords=Terrible+estate+agent+photos) or ["Film in five seconds"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Film-Five-Seconds-Great-Moments/dp/1848662963).

And finally some friends decide to make me a visit in London!

### December

Mostly Christmas. It's everywhere. Also, I start getting my hands seriously dirty with Android and Arduino. I publish a couple of (still very simple) apps in the Play Store, which made me spend a lot of spare time learning Android. And most important! I'll get married on June 2016 (yes, 2016, still a year and a half to go) :) Yes, I've deliberately hidden this info here so only friends will actually notice it – who else would read this post anyway?

_Pretty shite right now, but this app in particular stays as simple as I need it for my daily usage._

### January

Back in Vitoria for 10 days. There's Jamón and Chorizo everywhere, such a porky paradise. As usual during Christmas, I get to see all those people I only see once a year.

And finally, I get back to London to find out my flat electricity is totally screwed. This is the hole they dug in front of my flat.
