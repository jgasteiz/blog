Title: New Year's Resolutions for 2016
Date: 2016-01-12

In the past few months I've noticed I'm barely able to write anything on a paper. My calligraphy has gone to shit since I left uni and at this pace I'm going to have to relearn how to write.

The only thing I've been able to come up with to avoid that is to start having a pocket todo diary, instead of using Todoist (sorry, Todoist). Hopefully, by writing a bit every day I will soon remember how to do it.

I guess this is a classic 21st century problem.
