Title: Moebius exhibition, at Max Ernst Museum (Br√ºhl)
Date: 2019-11-18

This last weekend I've been visiting Cologne and there _happened_ to be an art exhibition about Moebius in a town nearby (this was no accident).

Moebius was Jean Giraud's artist name, who was born in France in 1938 and passed away on 2012. If you like European comic, you definitely know who he was - if you don't, you might have still heard of him.

He's mainly known for:
- Blueberry, in my opinion the best western ever made.
- Metal Hurlant / Heavy Metal magazine, where he started most of his sci-fi work.
- The Incal, a sci-fi series written by A. Jodorowsky.
- A lot of collaborations and design work for the movie industry, to mention a few names: The Fifth Element, Tron, Alien, Jodorowsky's Dune (which unfortunately never happened, but his designs inspired other movies).

I went to the exhibition yesterday and oh boy, that was good.
