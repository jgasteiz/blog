Title: Moebius exhibition, at Max Ernst Museum (Br√ºhl)
Date: 2019-11-18

Last weekend I've been visiting Cologne and there _happened_ to be an art exhibition about Moebius in a town nearby (just joking, this was no accident).

Moebius was Jean Giraud's artist name, who was born in France in 1938 and passed away on 2012. If you like European comic, you have probably heard of him, but if you haven't, he's mainly known for:
- Blueberry, in my opinion the best western ever made.
- Metal Hurlant / Heavy Metal magazine, where he started most of his sci-fi work.
- The Incal, a sci-fi series written by A. Jodorowsky.
- A lot of collaborations and design work for the movie industry, to mention a few names: The Fifth Element, Tron, Alien, Jodorowsky's Dune (which unfortunately never happened, but his designs inspired other movies).

Here are some of the best pictures I took at the exhibition.
