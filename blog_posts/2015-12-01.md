Just came back from the yearly Potato offsite and this year was in Phuket (Thailand).

This was my second time this year (and in my life too) in Thailand and both trips couldn't have been more different. Not in a bad way at all, they were actually great in their own way: the first one was very active and this one was extremely relaxing - just what we needed anyway. Most of the pictures I took are sunsets, beaches and swimming pools so there's not much to show, unfortunately.

Something you usually assume before going to a [Potato](https://p.ota.to/) offsite is that "no matter where it is, you'll have a great time". There's such a good vibe between all of us that we would have fun even in Reading - no disrespect, Reading.

It's great to be part of this family. To many more years!
