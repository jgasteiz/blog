Title: 2020 in pictures
Date: 2021-02-04

2020 has gone by very fast, and I've somehow just remembered I had a blog!
I haven't done anything particularly remarkable in 2020, but here's a
summary of what I've been up to.

The year started well, like every year ever, with my birthday. I didn't 
know it at the time, but this would be the last party with friends in
a very long time!

February came, and a couple of cool things happened:

* We discovered an amazing bagel bakery with delicious salt beef.
* We spent over a week in Mauritius, around the same time that 
  COVID-19 started hitting a few countries in Europe.

With March, the first lockdown came. Prior to this time, I would have
worked from home once a week. Changing to doing it every day had its
challenges at the beginning, but I think that we all got used to it
fairly quickly.

Lockdown didn't only bring continuous WFH, it also brought a bunch of
other great things:

* I started running a lot.
* I started having my _daily beer_ (between April and September!).
* We baked a few bread loaves.
* We did a bit of outdoor DIY – we restored our garden table and 
  chairs, and an old bicycle that we inherited with the flat.
* I grew the longest beard I've ever had – I miss it :(

By August lockdown was over, and we were able to meet with some people
again, so we organised a couple of small barbeques, and we got to use
our recently refurbished garden furniture.

Before Summer was over, we managed to escape London for a few days
to visit our family in Poland.

In October, it was time to visit Spain, which was the highlight of Autumn.
Luckily we managed to spend 10 days over there, which were very needed. 
We ate as much as we could, and I remember it took me weeks until I was back
at my pre-Spain trip running speed.

When we arrived in London, our 15-day quarantine overlapped with the
beginning of a new lockdown, that lasted until the beginning of
December. I honestly don't remember anything from November, but
December was the month when we received a couple of amazing Christmas
packages from our families in Poland and Spain :)

On the last day of 2020, we went to Hampstead Heath for a long walk.

Bonus picture of our Christmas tree, which at the time of writing this, 
is still up (we like it too much).

That was 2020. All things considered, we had a pretty good 2020. We both
got to keep our jobs and keep busy for the entire year. We and our 
friends and families have been healthy, so there's nothing we can complain
about. Let's hope 2021 will be better though.
