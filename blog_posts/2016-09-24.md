Title: PotatoCon 6 - Tenerife
Date: 2016-09-24

It's been almost a week since we came back from this year's PotatoCon, so it's time to write something about it.

Every year gets harder and harder to tell which PotatoCon has been the best. They are all special in their own way. This has been my fourth PotatoCon, but the first one in Europe – being the previous ones in USA (twice) and Thailand – and they couldn't have picked a better location.

I'm going to highlight two things from this year's PotatoCon.

1. It's great being able to talk to colleagues I normally don't get the chance to talk to. There are truly amazing people in this company. I only regret not having talked to more of them! It's also impressive the fact everyone gets along with everyone. And even more impressive taking into account we were sixty four Potatoes this year. I guess we only hire nice people :).

2. The food. Oh god, the food was amazing. We were extremely lucky we were in an amazing hotel and absolutely all the food they made in there was incredible. Even the dishes that are not typical from the Canary Islands. Food is definitely in the top 3 of "things I miss from Spain".

Now, some pictures of the adventure:

We were drinking lots of cava while watching the sun going down.

A couple of days later we went on a boat trip. Which is becoming a tradition, this is my third boat trip in a PotatoCon so far.

It was actually a boat party. The theme was "Pirates!". But it was hot and most of the people undressed pretty quickly.

The last day we went to a pretty awesome water park, but I obviously left my phone in the lockers and there are no pictures/proof of that.

To end this post, here's a time-lapse a colleague made watching the sunset in the Teide National Park, at around 2200m.
