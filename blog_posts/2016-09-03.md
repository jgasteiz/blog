Title: 1Password
Date: 2016-09-03


## The problem

For years, I've been the kind of person who always used the same three or four passwords for every single online service I used to have. Every time one of these services [got hacked](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), I was supposed to change the password I was using for that service and in every other place I was using that same password. Obviously, I wasn't keeping track of that, so I used to miss many of them.

Then 2 factor auth came to be and I started activating it for every service I considered important: Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, Github, Gitlab... That made me feel much safer. But it had a couple of inconveniences:
 
 1. Not every service offers 2 factor authentication and not all of them would offer the SMS one â€“ I know it's not the safest, but it's the one I chose.
 2. I would need my phone with me at all time, with network signal and the UK number active.

To be fair, it felt safe enough and I've been living like this for the last three years or so.

Then a few days ago I got an email from Dropbox, saying I need to change my password (again) because millions of account credentials have been leaked (again). That got me a bit upset, so I finally got proactive about it and started looking for a solution to my problem - because the fact I'm not dealing with my security properly is my problem, not Dropbox.

## The solution

I got myself [1Password](https://1password.com/security/).

I've changed every password in every single online service I've used during this week and updated every single 2 factor auth code to use the 1Password app rather than my phone - equivalent of using Google Authenticator, for instance.

*Most* of the pain and insecurity has disappeared! Now all my passwords are different, between 30 and 40 characters long, combining letters, symbols and numbers. Just a couple of minor caveats:

 1. I still need to remember one single, safe password. No problem with this, the passwords I was using in the past were (apparently) quite safe. I just had to come up with a new one and learned it.
 2. It's still not the great experience using it in the phone. Not very comfortable having to introduce the master password in the phone every time I need to get another password or OTP code.

## Summary

Get a password manager or a service that will help you coming up with secure passwords for your online services. At least for the important ones. Here's something a colleage from Potato has been working on recently: [TwistPass](https://twistpass.com/).

I've also heard great things about [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/).
